**Brain Tumor Classification**

**Overview:**
	
 This project is a beginner-friendly exploration into the field of machine learning applied to medical imaging. It focuses on classifying brain images into two categories: healthy and with tumors. Utilizing a dataset from Kaggle, the model demonstrates high accuracy in distinguishing between healthy brains and those affected by tumors.


**Dataset:**
The dataset used for this project is sourced from Kaggle and comprises images categorized into two classes:

- Healthy
- Brain tumor
The images were split into training and validation sets, allowing the model to learn and then validate its learning on unseen data.


**Results:**
After conducting approximately 10 tests, the model achieved an impressive accuracy of 99%. This high level of accuracy suggests that the model is highly effective at distinguishing between the two categories.


**How to Run:**
To replicate or further develop this project, follow these steps:

Clone this repository,
Install the required dependencies if necessary,
run brain_tumor_classification.py 


**Future Work:
Potential future enhancements for this project include:**

Implementing additional data augmentation techniques to improve model robustness.

Testing the model on a more diverse set of images to ensure its effectiveness across different demographics and scanner types.

Exploring more complex models or ensemble techniques to further improve accuracy.

Currently working on using Streamlit to add a UI aspect where the user can input an image not from the dataset and then the model analyzes it and determines whether there is a brain tumor or not.
