**Brain Tumor Classification**

**Overview:**
	
 This project is a beginner-friendly exploration into the field of machine learning applied to medical imaging. It focuses on classifying brain images into two categories: healthy and with tumors. Utilizing a dataset from Kaggle, the model demonstrates high accuracy in distinguishing between healthy brains and those affected by tumors. It also contains a UI where the user can upload a X-ray image and the model will determine whether there is a Tumor or not. (Just Completed) 


**Dataset:**
The dataset used for this project is sourced from Kaggle and comprises images categorized into two classes:

- Healthy
- Brain tumor
The images were split into training and validation sets, allowing the model to learn and then validate its learning on unseen data.


**Results:**
After conducting approximately 10 tests, the model achieved an impressive accuracy of 99%. This high level of accuracy suggests that the model is highly effective at distinguishing between the two categories.


**How to Run:**
To replicate or further develop this project, follow these steps:

Clone this repository,
Install the required dependencies if necessary,
run brain_tumor_classification.py
then: Streamlit run App.py by adding the model you generate in place of the model already there


**Future Work:
Potential future enhancements for this project include:**

Implementing additional data augmentation techniques to improve model robustness.

Testing the model on a more diverse set of images to ensure its effectiveness across different demographics and scanner types.

Exploring more complex models or ensemble techniques to further improve accuracy.
